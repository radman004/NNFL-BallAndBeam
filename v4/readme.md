## Instructions to get this running locally, since it's not a Jupyter notebook.

1. to create a virtual environment that will also help avoid package version clashes:
python -m venv env

2. to activate it
env\Scripts\Activate

3. package requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. bbs-copy is a less complex version, saved here as a checkpoint ig.

5. the results folder has all the outputs and the logs of the execution.
